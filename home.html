          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <pre>
            It all started on Feb 24. 
            Actually no, it all started 8 years ago, when after Maidan of 2014 
            (where Ukrainians prove their pre-European path) Russia annexed the Crimea 
            and started occupation of Eastern areas of Ukraine (part of Donbass and Lugatsk regions). 
            
            But on the 24th of Feb of 2022, Russia started full-scale war agains Ukraine. 
            People around the country woke up hearing sirens goinf off. 
            The attacks were scattered accross many cities. 

            The Russion plan was to take over Kyiv within 2d, Kharkiv - within 1d. 
            Then they expected to set up a kind of puppet gov and put out the riots of those 
            protesting within 10d. Of course Europe will be 'concerned' but who cares. 
            How do we know all of that? Because fucking morons were so sure of quick victory that the
            key russian paper got an article out on 26th of Feb declaring the victory and 
            the reunion of ussr empire. 
            But they miscalculated many factors, and now itâ€™s 2nd of March 
            (7th day of the russian-Ukrainian war) and we still proudly stand.
