          <h3>Day 19</h3>
          <pre>
           Still standing.
           After the first few days rush of adrenaline, and then a few days
           of pure hatred, pain and sorrow, now it almost feels like we can feel 
           nothing. The only thing left is certainty that there is no other way.
           After all of this finished, we'll have to overcome huge outburst of the pain
           we're opressing now.

        <div id="overview">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <pre>
            It all started on Feb 24. 
            Actually no, it all started 8 years ago, when after Maidan of 2014 
            (where Ukrainians proved their pre-European path) Russia annexed the Crimea 
            and started occupation of Eastern areas of Ukraine (part of Donbas and Lugatsk regions). 
            
            But on the 24th of Feb of 2022, Russia started full-scale war against Ukraine. 
            People around the country woke up hearing sirens going off. 
            The attacks were scattered accross many cities. 

            The Russion plan was to take over Kyiv within 2d, Kharkiv - within 1d. 
            Then they expected to set up a kind of puppet gov and put out the riots of those 
            protesting within 10d. Of course Europe will be 'concerned' but who cares. 
            How do we know all of that? Because fucking morons were so sure of quick victory that the
            key russian paper got an article out on 26th of Feb declaring the victory and 
            the reunion of ussr empire [article was set for auto-publish, removed within minutes, 
            but google caches everything.. haha]. 
            But they miscalculated many factors, and now it`s 2nd of March 
            (7th day of the russian-Ukrainian war) and we still proudly stand.

          <h3>Why do we still stand?</h3>
          <pre>
            Ukrainian history is a story of stuggle for independence. 
            Nowadays the war has united the Ukrainian people and the world in defence of democracy. 

            We're here at our HOME, and there's no plan B for us.
            Majority of my friends/relatives never wanted to immigrate. 
            And living under the oppression of monster-regime is not an option as well.
            All we can and will do - fight! Till the end...

            Here in Ukraine EVERYONE is involved in the war. 
            Our army got much stronger during 8 years of war on the Eastern-South part of Ukraine 
            (thanks god they didn`t try to invade in 2014, we would have been doomed). 
            But these days our volunteers got a solid understanding of how and where to get stuff 
            (ammunition and gear) necessary to supply our army. 
            Thanks to the world support we got some modern military necessities: javelins, NLAWs, bayraktars.

            Apart from army, all the cities got local military groups. 
            Those are common people trained and equipped. They are told to be really helpful in the guérilla. 
            Fun fact, the war started on 24th, and those local armies were overflooded with people 
            trying to join. So those applying on 26th and further are enlisted and waiting meanwhile. 
            National joke is people trying to bribe to get higher in the list and get to the fight with russians.

          <h3>Common people war activities</h3>
          <pre>
           As was stated above, EVERYONE is involved, common people:
           * help refugees from north-east-south (organizing shelters, foods, etc)
           * transport the military equipment to the war zone
           * collect money and buy equipment in Europe. 
           Volunteers gather fantastic sums within hours, because everyone knows `time matters`
           * prepare food for different needs
           * transport of the food and medicine to the war zone
           * transport humanitarian aids from EU and other partners to different locations
           * prepare Molotov cocktails and knit camouflage nets
           * donate blood (on the 2nd day of war they started rejecting people)
           * internet army is also sleepless: there are comprehensive guides on ddos attacks 
           so even 10y old are working on that frontline. 
           All major Russian services are down for the last 4 days. 
           Russian propaganda sites, social network channels — are being blocked.
           * people are constantly working on info sharing, 
           show the latest updates on twitter/facebook, get involved into international 
           discussions with people around the globe.

         Please spare me of all the 'poor russians' rhetoric. There are none. 
         First of all, they made lots of choices into that direction. 
         Being ignorant is their choice. Supporting this war is their choice.
         They chose to believe their propaganda because they like it.
         And now they have to pay.
         The majority of them really support the current war. They see what 
         their army is doing, they know exactly what's happening and they do 
         support it. Their pride in 
         <i>'WE ARE RUSSIANS! (americans are stupid, europeans are weak)'</i> is still 
         super strong.
         Part of those 'No war' -- were completely 'FOR' annexation of Crimea, invation
         into e of Ukraine in 2014, Georgia of 2008, Syria of 2015, Chechnya and many others.
         The sure thing is, if this war went well for russia there would be almost no 
         'no war'-s. 

         Yes, those protesting in russia.. yes, it's hard for them,
         but that's because they allowed it to become this way.
         I really like the analogy - if you don't pay of the credit cards,
         the longer you wait - the harder it is to pay off.
         The democracy is a choice.
